<!-- # More Details On Development

if you want to know more details keep reading I go over:
- tools I developed

## Level Editor 
{{< youtube L6dnDOCIKUE >}}

the level editor read and wrote the level details in a binary format which was put into a .Map file which I then wrote an importer to handle loading that data which would build the tiles and all the "event blocks"

![MapFilesPng](/projects/MapFiles.png)

the tiles were all preloaded into the editor based on tilesets that were in the game so as soon as I added in a new tileset into the game it would appear in the editor.

essentially all the data structure was for each layer it was a 2d array of tile codes that when parsed read the correct tile from memory and placed it in the correct location in the world space.

"Event blocks" were positions in the world where on level loading they would spawn either a collidable event or a entity itself. if it was a collidable event then it would fire off some delegate after it was collided with by the player.

the red blocks tint on some of the blocks indicated which tiles where collidable as I wanted the player to be able to walk behind/in front of tiles but also have it so there was collision still so I handled that seperatly with these tint indications. -->
