      <description>Introduction I go through the math&amp;rsquo;s behind what makes a clock tick including the positioning of the handles and basic triganometry.&#xA;Inspiration The inspiration for this post came from a blog article by CatlikeCoding on basic game objects in unity.&#xA;I wanted to document my expirence and what I learnt by going through this&#xA;Trigonometry before going through this guide I knew about concepts like cos(x) and sin(x), however I had no clue on how they related to other concepts such as circles/angles/etc.</description>

      <description>Introduction This was a project I developed during off times after my 2nd year at university along side my placement year, I followed a lot of concepts from Multiplayer Game Programming: Architecting Networked Games (Game Design) by Josh Glazer and Sanjay Madhav and Programming Multiplayer Games by Andrew Mulholland and Teijo Hakala&#xA;Status The Current Status of this project is complete as it was only meant to showcase off simple socket programming concepts so I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to take this game idea further</description>

      <description>Introduction Journey through the mountain is a game I developed for my 2nd year 2nd semester at staffordshire university.&#xA;the story behind the development descsion to use Monogame and c# compared to off the shelf game engine such as unity or unreal was I wanted to familurise myself with a typical game loop and game flow.&#xA;Status The current status of the project is currenty on hold it has a couple of issues still such as the falling mechanic not working quite right and the obvious screen resolution issue, I may re-write the game in a different framework when I revist it.</description>
